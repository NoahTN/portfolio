skills: [Python, AWS]
---
A Twitter bot created as part of a team of five in the Startup Monterey Bay 2019 Hackathon.
I helped to mentor my team in Python and API calls, incorporating four different sources of information on 
local weather, traffic, and electrical conditions. I'm very proud of my team and I for finishing it.
