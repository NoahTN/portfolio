A mobile game for learning Japanese Mahjong that I developed to practice both my game and programming knowledge.
I leveraged Google's Flutter framework and learned Dart as part of its creation. It has dynamic AI opponents and useful tile labeling for beginners. 
Eventually, I want to revisit this project using a more suitable tool.
